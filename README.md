# üå¨Ô∏è Oxygen: The Breath of BlazeWatch üå¨Ô∏è

Oxygen is the backend code powering BlazeWatch, handling both Ingress (incoming messages) and Egress (broadcasting to social media stations) through Memphis. With data storage in Supabase and seamless integration with Postgres, it fuels the flames of fire detection.

## Configuration

First, ensure to rename `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the relevant credentials:

```bash
MEMPHIS_HOSTNAME=string
MEMPHIS_USERNAME=string
MEMPHIS_PASSWORD=string
MEMPHIS_ACCOUNT_ID=string
DB_URL=string
DB_USER=string
DB_PASSWORD=string
```

> **Note**: For the DB, make sure to use Postgres! You can acquire a free PostgreSQL database on Supabase. The `temp_readings` tables should be created on script startup. Make sure that you have a zakar-tweets station!

## Installation & Running

Build and run the Oxygen Service by executing the following commands in the root repository directory:

```bash
docker build . --no-cache -t oxygen_backend:latest
docker run oxygen_backend:latest
```
